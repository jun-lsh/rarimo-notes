Rarimo is trying to come up with a whole identity issuing and verification protocol/framework everything-in-one solution and got lost in the sauce at some point.

The ZK passport is an interesting idea with a sound implementation, largely relying on the technical aspects of biometric passports that have made them a secure identification document IRL, albeit with some pretty glaring caveats that would make a more large scale or mission critical use-case out of reach for the time being. 

There is an immediate upside in sybilling being much, _much_ harder as your means of accomplishing such an attack for, say, a passport-enabled airdrop, require jumping significantly higher hurdles (going to Malta or straight up theft). However, if you wish to speak of using such a system for something like a state election? Tough luck if you're trying to beat out a corrupt authoritarian government. 

As for the rest of the protocol... I see nothing that stands out in particular which warrants any interest in the RMO token, the whole "identity state replication" oracle network or the Rarimo "identity provider" framework (which counterintuitively requires immense trust in Rarimo as an organisation to permit who can issue identities). The Rarimo Core comes across as a very nothingburger cross-chain communication solution, with the key selling point simply being that it can behave as an aggregator for other identity providers like Worldcoin and "Gitcoin Passport".

Going back to [Vitalik's article](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.html) on biometric proof of humanity as a whole, I draw your attention to this table:

Rarimo wants to have a cake and eat it too. ZKPs do appear to help switch that "privacy" column for social-graph-based solutions to maybe Medium? As the security and anti-traceability of Rarimo is still heavily reliant on there being enough entries in the Sparse Merkle Tree to make it harder to trace. 

But all in all, for Rarimo we've got like, one interesting idea in ZK passports that's been decently executed followed by a whole bunch of auxiliary crap that acts as a real wet blanket.
